        Who is this love letter to? Perhaps someone or something that you love? Or maybe someone or something who you think a love letter might be generative for? Let’s begin creating a container for the beginning of our letter. Inside that container we will add the recipient inside of an <em>h1 tag</em>. So “Dear …”<br><br>
        Change background color of body.<br><br>
        Now let’s write the opening paragraph in a <em>p tag</em>.<br><br>
        Reminder that someone else in the next round will be adding on here so write with as much specificity as you want but also if you can with a kind of openness.
