      <h2>hi :-)</h2>
      <p>
        before we begin...
        <br>
        <br>
        i'm having a moment where i think
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>all computation is metaphor</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>webpages are just files insides of folders on a server</em>
        <br>
        <br>
        and a server is just a computer that holds folders which don't actually exist instead they just tell the computer how to get to the files which in the end are just bits of data encoded in such a way that the computer can store them in memory which is also a metaphor.
        <br>
        <br>
        and so...because all computation is metaphor then <strong>programming is an abstraction</strong>. more so i think it gives us the illusion of control and a feeling of power and i'm wondering...is this why the world wide web, and maybe just computational technology in general, is so messed up? has programming gone so far as to give programmers the illusion that they are actually controlling their computers in such a way that everything they do must be right?
        <br>
        <br>
        i'm interested in <strong>slowing down code</strong> and <em>eroding this notion of control</em>. today we are going to make webpages by carefully typing out html and css on each others computers
        <code>
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>ok with that said...<span>&lt;&sol;p&gt;</span>
        </code>

    <section class="intro">
      <h2>what is hand coding</h2>
      <p>
        all webpages are just files and <em>all</em> of them have a file called the <strong>index.html</strong> file. this is <em>always</em> the first file that you see when you go to a website. even the really fancy ones.
        <br>
        <br>
        in this workshop we are going to move away from the bloated websites of 2019 and <strong>learn how to build a webpage slowly, by hand, and with care</strong>. its possible it will look like a webpage from the 90s but it doesn't have to. the funny thing is that the languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are very much the same now as they were back then and its more about your content, how you style it and how you leverage the inherent functionality of these three languages.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>1</h2>
      <p>
         open the <strong>index.html</strong> file that you downloaded before this workshop, it should be on your desktop, open it in a text editor like Atom or Sublime. also make sure that you have a webbrowser open in the background so that other students can easily access it when they are one your computer.
         <br>
         <br>
         lets look at the css at the top of page, line 16
         <br>
         <br>
         <strong>everything underneath the word body is where you'll put the most <em>basic styles</em> for your web page.</strong> these can be things like the backgroud color, or maybe a border. you can use padding to add space between the edge of the browser and the content on your page. get souped ! choose pixel values and colors that you <em>feel</em> good about.
        <br>

        <pre>
          body {<br>
            border: 10px solid blue;<br>
            background-color: yellowgreen;<br>
            color: mediumpurple;<br>
            font-size: 30px;<br>
          }<br>
        </pre>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>2</h2>
        <p>
          scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag
          <br>
          <br>
          inside of an <strong>h1 tag</strong>, please write a sentence or phrase responding to this prompt:
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>think of a metaphor for the world wide web.</strong> you might write something like: <em>the world wide web is a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs, with extra parmigiano-reggiano</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          make sure to write something that you would want your peers to see
          <br>
          <br>
          and that its something fun for them respond to !
          <br>
          <code>
            <span>&lt;h1 id="metaphor"&gt;</span>the world wide web is a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs, with extra parmigiano-reggiano<span>&lt;&sol;h1&gt;</span>
          </code>
          <br>
          <br>
          after you add your metaphor, scroll back up to the CSS section and add some styles to your new element using the metaphor id:
        <pre>
          #metaphor {<br>
            font-size: 38px;<br>
            position: absolute;<br>
            top: 40px;<br>
            left: 20px;<br>
            color: hotpink;
          }<br>
        </pre>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>3</h2>
      <p>
        scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag, a few lines below the h1 tag
        <br>
        <br>
         <strong>p tag</strong> inside of an <strong>div tag</strong>, please write a short response to the h1 tag phrase, think about the subtext of the metaphor:
        <br>
        <br>
        you should also <strong>add an id</strong>, the name of the id can be anything you want, refer to the id in your css to add styles
       <code>
         <span>&lt;div id="response"&gt;</span><br>
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>all of the fiber optic cables are like a big mess of spaghetti, facebook, amazon, google, just a bunch of meatballs, but the sprinkling of hand coded websites on top of it all makes it ok<span>&lt;&sol;p&gt;</span><br>
        <span>&lt;&sol;div&gt;</span>
       </code>

       <pre>
         #response {<br>
           font-size: 48px;<br>
           color: orangered;<br>
           transform: rotate(-25deg);<br>
           background-color: blanchedalmond;<br>
           border-radius: 50%;<br>
         }<br>
       </pre>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>4</h2>
      <p>
        scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag, a few lines below the response div
        <br>
        <br>
        create an <strong>image tag:</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>
          <span>&lt;img id="<em>first-image</em>" alt="<em>description of the image</em>" src=""<span>&sol;&gt;</span>
        </code>
        <br>
        <br>
        now open a browser window and search for an image in response to the text inside of the p tag
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>paste the url</strong> for the image <strong>inside of the quotes</strong> after the <strong>src</strong> attribute
        <br>
        <br>
        it should look something like this
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>
          <span>&lt;img id="<em>name-of-image-id</em>" alt="<em>description of the image</em>" src="<em>http://url-of-image.com</em>"<span>&sol;&gt;</span>
        </code>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>5</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>what is the name of the id on the image tag?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        scroll up to the css section of the document an create a list of styles for that id
        <br>
        <br>
        it should look something like this
        <br>
        <br>
        the css tells your image to take up 80% of the window width, try out some of the styles like the position and transform rules
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>save your file</strong> and open it in a browser to see what it looks like
        <br>
        <br>
        now you can add more styles to your image
        <pre>
          #name-of-id {<br>
            width: 80%<br>
            position: absolute;<br>
            top: 80px;<br>
            right: 10px;<br>
            transform: rotate(-20deg);<br>
          }
        </pre>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>6</h2>
      <p>
        take a moment to look at the web page in the browser
        <br>
        <br>
        go back to the index.html file, look at the code carefully
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>what is the subtext or hidden meaning of this web page? put your thoughts inside of an h2 tag and style it!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        if you want you can uncomment the javascript at the bottom of the file, test it out and make changes !
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>7</h2>
      <p>
        return to your computer!
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>add one more p tag</strong> to your html, give it a unique id, write a short response to any of the content on the page
        <br>
        <br>
        add some styles to your new p element, it should look something like this, try some of the styles below if you have't already:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre>
          #name-of-p-id {
