    <section class="intro">
      <h2>1</h2>
      <p>
        In leading up to this workshop I have been thinking a lot about computation as metaphor. I'm having a moment where I believe all computational processes to be always and already built on top of metaphor which in turn requires that programming, as we know it today, be a set of abstract concepts. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>2</h2>
      <p>
        By this, I mean that if computers at their core are just complex sets of on and off switches then coding requires that we abstract away those complexities in order to have our computers do what we want them to do.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>3</h2>
      <p>
        Enter the GUI. A file inside a folder on a desktop. The office metaphor, one which we will never get away from. But what is the file really? And what is the folder? I just learned that folders aren't actually anything. They don't take up *any* space on your computer.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>4</h2>
      <p>
        Since folders and files, which if we looked closely at them might not resemble anything close to a piece of paper inside a folded piece of paper, are already metaphors for underlying computational processes and therefore already abstractions of code required for physical computation to occur then the feeling of control that we as users of computers have is an illusion.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>5</h2>
      <p>
        I think it's important to note this illusion. I think having an illusion of control leads programmers down a potentially dangerous path. Programmers, through the creation of complex processes and algorithmic systems go through so many hurdles trying to get the computer to do what they want it to do. When the computer finally obeys their commands they are granted with this feeling of immense gratification and power.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>6</h2>
      <p>
        I'm wondering, if the process of programming a smartphone application, for instance, is rooted in notions of command and control and illusion and power, does this make for potentially dangerous results? Does it perhaps mean that programmers get so caught up in the power dynamic between themselves and their computer that they lose sight of how what they're doing lives in the real world alongside real humans?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>7</h2>
      <p>
        What would it mean if programmers had to manually move the switches to on and off positions in order to make their program work? What if programmers had to press the keys of their keyboards so gently that it required them to move extremely slow and therefore with care?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="intro">
      <h2>8</h2>
      <p>
        Enter hand coding. Hand coding is the process of development that brings the gap between you as the programmer and your computer, specifically your browser, as the performer of the program. The code you will write in this workshop will be very particular and you will write out each character slowly and by hand, no copying or pasting. You will also do this on each other computers - the intention here is to perhaps erode this feeling of ultimate control that you have over your computer's system and to move carefully around someone else's.
      </p>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>1</h2>
      <p>
         find the index.html file on your desktop. <strong>rename the file to your-name.html</strong>
         <br>
         <br>
         double click the file to <strong>open file in a browser</strong>. you should also <strong>open the file in a text editor</strong>. both the browser window and text editor window should be easily accessible so that other students can easily work on the file.
         <br>
         <br>
         let's look at the file in a text editor together...make a CSS change to the body tag
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>2</h2>
        <p>
          scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag
          <br>
          <br>
          inside of an <strong>h1 tag</strong>, please write a sentence or phrase responding to this prompt:
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>think of a metaphor for the world wide web.</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          make sure to write something that you would want your peers to see
          <br>
          <br>
          and that its something fun for them respond to !
          <br>
          <br>
          <code>
            <span>&lt;h1 id="metaphor"&gt;</span>the world wide web is a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs, with extra parmigiano-reggiano<span>&lt;&sol;h1&gt;</span>
          </code>
          <br>
          <br>
          after you add your metaphor, scroll back up to the CSS section and add some styles to your new element using the metaphor id:
        <!-- <pre>
          #metaphor {<br>
            font-size: 38px;<br>
            position: absolute;<br>
            top: 40px;<br>
            left: 20px;<br>
            color: hotpink;
          }<br>
        </pre> -->
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>3</h2>
      <p>
        scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag, a few lines below the h1 tag
        <br>
        <br>
         <strong>p tag</strong> inside of an <strong>div tag</strong>, please write a short response to the h1 tag phrase, think about the subtext of the metaphor:
        <br>
        <br>
        you should also <strong>add an id</strong>, the name of the id can be anything you want, refer to the id in your css to add styles
       <code>
         <span>&lt;div id="response"&gt;</span><br>
          <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>all of the fiber optic cables are like a big mess of spaghetti, facebook, amazon, google, just a bunch of meatballs, but the sprinkling of hand coded websites on top of it all makes it ok<span>&lt;&sol;p&gt;</span><br>
        <span>&lt;&sol;div&gt;</span>
       </code>

       <!-- <pre>
         #response {<br>
           font-size: 48px;<br>
           color: orangered;<br>
           transform: rotate(-25deg);<br>
           background-color: blanchedalmond;<br>
           border-radius: 50%;<br>
         }<br>
       </pre> -->
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>4</h2>
      <p>
        now open a browser window and search for an image in response to something written in the file
        <br>
        <br>
        copy the image address to your clipboard
        <br>
        <br>
        back in the editor, scroll down and place your cursor somewhere inside the body tag, a few lines below the response div
        <br>
        <br>
        create an <strong>image tag</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>paste the url</strong> for the image <strong>inside of the quotes, after src=</strong> attribute
        <br>
        <br>
        don't forget to add a description of the image inside the alt text attribute!!
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>
          <span>&lt;img id="<em>name-of-image-id</em>" alt="<em>description of the image</em>" src="<em>http://url-of-image.com</em>"<span>&sol;&gt;</span>
        </code>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>5</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>what is the name of the id on the image tag?</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        scroll up to the css section of the document an create a list of styles for that id
        <br>
        <br>
        it should look something like this
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>this css tells your image to take up 20% of the window width</strong>, try out some of the styles like the position and transform rules
        <br>
        <br>
        save your file and open it in a browser to see what it looks like
        <br>
        <br>
        now you can add more styles to your image
        <pre>
          #name-of-id {<br>
            width: 20%;<br>
            transform: rotate(-20deg);<br>
          }
        </pre>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="workshop">
      <h2>6</h2>
      <p>
        take a moment to look at the web page in the browser
        <br>
        <br>
        go back to the index.html file, look at the code carefully
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>what is the subtext or hidden meaning of this web page? put your thoughts inside of an h2 tag and style it!</strong>

        <strong>add one more p tag</strong> to your html, give it a unique id
        <br>
        <br>
        add some styles to your new p element, it should look something like this, try some of the styles below if you have't already
        <br>
        <br>
        inside of the p tag <strong>describe how it felt to write code on someone else's computer? <br><br>what does it feel like to write code on your computer?</strong>
