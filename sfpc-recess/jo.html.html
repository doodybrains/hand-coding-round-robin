        Made of leather, metal, and steel - depending on the manufacturer, the materials can be sourced and recycled using waste from other products or can be sourced directly from the original natural resource. 

        Iron and steel is separated from the e-waste, then aluminum, copper and circuit boards are separated. After the bulk metal is removed, the e-waste stream, which is now mainly plastic, is further separated into ABS from polystyrene plastic.
