First, I will introduce some of my thinking around hand coding and computation..........When I first started to put together this workshop in 2019, I was thinking a lot about machines and metaphors. I had taken a class with American Artist and we read the media theorist Wendy Chun who has a very important essay called Software as Ideology that continues to influence my experience as a teacher of code. To start thinking about metaphor together we can think the computers we are all using today in the workshop, you have a bunch of icons and ways of doing things that represent physical being-in-the-world objects and ways of doing things in an in a space like an office or a classroom. You have a trash can and you have folders to put things into and you have notepads and writing tools. I know most of us compute on our phones, but there too is a notepad or a trash for your emails or we could even think about the sound that your camera makes when it takes a photo as a metaphor. Computers started to look like this around the 1960s when they were entering office spaces that had previously relied on typewriters and later electronic typing machines. What is interesting is that the graphical user interface (this visual space of your computer that you are looking at right now with icons and a mouse cursor) was claimed along with the personal computer as “for everyone” but at the time it was really for everyone who was already familiar with how office work works.  ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

I think its important to think about this because metaphors, like the metaphor of "trash" for example, carry with them ideas from the physical world that don't necessarily match up in the virtual world of a machine. When you put something in the trash, like in the physical real-world trash, does it ever really go away? Where does it go? When you put something in the trash on your computer, you are deleting it from the computer's memory and so in the machine world, it is actually disappearing. But is this the same as putting something in the physical trash? Can you delete plastic? Can you throw away a tweet? This all gets complicated when we consider the physical resources that computers need to perform the act of deleting and that humans need to perform the act of "throwing things away". And of course the idea of deletion gets complicated when we take into account big data and the internet where as soon as you upload something it becomes extremely hard to remove it from all of the places it may have already been dispersed to. My point here is not to say that because computers use metaphors they are bad but it is rather to say that its an interesting place to start thinking about our own relationships to them, what do we assume that they can do and how can we start to think more broadly about what they can and cannot do? ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

For now I want to share with you a very short pre-history of the mouse and its relationship to the screen. This is kind of a roundabout way to get to hand coding and metaphors and computing but for me their histories intertwine in an interesting way. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

This was the first computer to make its calculations in real time (Edwards). Before the Whirlwind, computers would take really long periods of time to process a program and would then require the physical adjustment of switches or punched cards, a re-programming, in order to run a process again. Originally designed as a flight simulator, the Whirlwind was able to receive inputs and produce outputs using a three-dimensional array of magnetic core memory. Magentic core memory is a kind of hardware and software design using magnetic wires which allowed for a program to be stored even if power was lost...so if the computer was turned off, the programming of the wires would still be intact. This technology was used in tandem with vacuum tube screens which in itself allowed for a graphical interface of computed data. **Jacob Gaboury** on the history of the computer screen writes “The screen is not simply an enduring technique or evocative metaphor; it is a hardware object whose transformations have shaped the material conditions of our visual culture.” ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

This is where the mouse’s predecessor, the light pen, materialized (Edwards). At the time of the light pen, computers were already much more than calculating machines, but they were not yet ubiquitously used for purposes outside of the military. The screen was still thought of as a substrate like paper, the analog substrate for tracking and storing, and the light pen was the next best iteration of moving from the analog act of writing to the digital act of pointing. In this sense, the problem of computing became not only the act of programming switches but also the act of moving on along x and y coordinates. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

In one direction the idea was to build up an autonomous intelligence that would match or even supersede human intelligence. The question, by the way, of “what intelligence actually is” still stands and in step with philosopher Hubert Dreyfus I think that artificial intelligence has proven to show us what computer can't do than what they can. In the other direction, a person named Douglas Engelbart led a research lab called the Augementation Research Center which sought to create a kind of intelligent symbiosis ~between~ the human and the computer. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Invented by Engelbart in 1964 the mouse was but a small part of a much larger system. Presented to the public as what later became known as “the mother of all demoes” the system that Engelbart and his colleagues built included some of the earliest versions of hyperlinks, multiple windows, real-time cross-computer collaboration (which is what we will be doing today), and finally, the use of a mouse. It was an amalgamation of devices, all situated within optimal distance for the hand to the mouse, the eyes to the screen. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Ok so here we are, back to the screen, back to the desktop. I like to think that the mouse brought us here. All of your office needs could be met by a series of keystrokes and clicks. And at this point, the mouse had become the standard input device for computing and was synonymous not only with interactivity and collaboration but also with work. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Just because one understands how to code does not mean that one fully understands technology. There are many different ways of approaching technology and fostering cross-disciplinary skills—coding is just one of them." This desktop metaphor ensured that computers require programming, as we know it today, to be a set of extremely abstract processes. So, when I’m coding something, I’m often coding on top of someone else’s code, in someone else’s software, on top of the software that makes up my operating system which is permanently baked into the proprietary silicon chip of my Apple computer.   Computers at their core still consist of a complex series of on and off switches, ones and zeroes except now the switches are like an extremely tiny mix of analog and digital signals and are nearly invisible to the human eye. This means that everything we do on our computers today is already abstracting away those complex patterns of numbers in order for us to use them in the way that we do. So these abstractions allow us to do things like writing text in a file, without thinking about how or even if the computer will be able to do this. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

When programmers were writing code for computers the size of rooms the time it took to run the program was really expensive, so people were always writing code that was most efficiently read by the computer itself not by the people who were making the programs. This reflects our current moment of computing where code is written in often illegible jargon and minified into unreadable blobs of text. This is why coding is intimidating, it seems to be a problem of language, some kind of insider’s club, but really it’s just been purposefully abstracted and a lot of the original languages from the 70s, 80s and 90s are still the foundation upon which so much code is written. As an example, today when someone builds a website the might use a mix of languages like Ruby, JavaScript and Python and then uses a mix of libraries and frameworks which someone else has written to compile all of it’s into the only three readable languages by the browser HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all of which haven’t changed in any major way since the mid 90s. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

And what is the folder? a computer scientist friend once told me that folders aren't actually anything. They don't take up *any* space on your computer. I often reflect on something Kameelah Janan Rasheed once said: "analogies are a poverty of language." In step with this provocation I am always wondering how the metaphors of files and folders, the analogies we use in our every day computing, have limited our imagination for what computing can be? If not for the baked in interface of the desktop what might we put on a screen emitting light? Or to think about it in a different way, what would it be like if we could hear all of the computation happening inside our laptops or our phones as we typed out an email? What are other ways of imagining what computers can do and how we could use them? Do they have to be connected to our telephones? Do they have to be rectangular? ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Since folders and files, which if we looked closely at them don’t resemble anything close to a piece of paper inside another folded piece of paper, I’m left wondering does the way that we use our computers also require some kind of illusion of control over our computers. The key word here being illusion. Programmers, through the creation of complex frameworks and algorithmic systems go through so many hurdles trying to get the computer to do what they want it to do. When the computer finally obeys their commands, they are granted with this feeling of immense gratification and power. I’ve felt this feeling of gratification as a programmer after hours and hours of trying to debug something I wrote. It’s a cyclical command and response from you to your computer. My provocation here is not to call for an undoing of this cycle of command and response but to become aware of what is happening in between. So instead of humans controlling computers and computers controlling humans I am interested in how computers and humans can be between, not over or under, one another. And hopefully that is how the workshop today will feel. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

It makes me wonder what it would be like if programmers had to press the keys of their keyboards so gently that it required them to move extremely slow and therefore with care? And so, all of these questions have led me to care deeply about hand coding. Hand coding is the process of coding that bridges the gap between you and the browser. In other words, it is a way to code which is not dependent on someone else’s software or framework or library, you are writing in the language that the browser understands, and the language that has been used since the 90s to make websites. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Not that this is bad or good but I’m interested in questioning relationships around the transparency, encoding and decoding, file systems, and proprietaryness of computing and doing something like hand coding is a step towards new questions about our relationships to these things. The pages we are looking at is from the last time I taught this workshop in person at SFPC. So the browser is software which translates HTML and CSS into web pages. Your browser is the performer of the program you are writing. What we are looking at right now is an web page and its code. I have written my lecture notes in the HTML file that is also making these images appear in this particular order with a black background behind them. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

The code you will write in this workshop will be very particular and you will write out each character slowly and by hand, there will be very little copying or pasting. We’ll move as slow as we want to and I will also be writing all the code out with you on my screen. You will also be coding on each other pages. The intention here is to perhaps erode this feeling of ultimate control that you have over your computer's system (or in the case of this online session, your web page) and to move carefully around someone else's. So, in this session we will be in discussion with each other not necessarily in a verbal way. Instead we’re going to be in conversation through the things we are writing on each other’s pages. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ questions? ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ open spreadsheet! ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->
