    Sewing Machine
</h2>
<h3>
    The sewing machine allows you to produce your own clothing. It helps me appreciate the labor that goes into a piece of clothing, because using it reminds me that sewing anything takes a lot of time and material. I also love the sewing machine because it helps my friend make cosplays, which brings her a lot of joy :]

<p class="swag">
    Industrial sewing machines are usually made from metal or very heavy plastic because needles go through a massive number of layers per minute. They need to be able to stand up against all kinds of wear and while still holding together well enough to do the job.


</p>
Different industrial sewing machines offer several ways to feed the material. Typically, industrial sewing machines that deliver numerous feed capabilities are more expensive. The main types of feed mechanisms are:

Drop feed: The feed mechanism lies below the machine's sewing surface. This is probably the most common feed type. Toothed segments called feed dogs lift and advance the fabric between each stitch, with the teeth pressing upwards and sandwiching the material against a presser foot.
Needle feed: The needle itself acts as the feed mechanism, which minimizes slippage and allows workers to sew multiple layers of fabric.
Walking foot: The immobile presser foot is replaced with a foot that moves with the feed, which allows easier performance on thick, spongy or cushioned materials.
Puller feed: The machine grips and pulls straight-seamed material as it is sewn and can perform on large, heavy-duty items such as canvas tents. 
Manual feed: The feed is controlled entirely by the worker, who can do delicate, personal work such as shoe repair, embroidering, and quilting. On industrial sewing machines, it is sometimes necessary to remove the feed dogs to obtain a manual feed.

    Whereas <i>traditional sewing machines</i> might include nylon or plastic gears, an industrial sewing machine's gears, connecting rods, housings, and body are typically constructed from high-quality metals, such as cast iron or aluminum.
